Author: James Lofty

This repository includes the following :

- an example video reccordings and example data
- a full bounding box automated detection routine for plastics in transport (0-6)
- scipts for the analysis of plastic sample settling velcity from video reccordings
- other statitical scripts from the experimental setup
